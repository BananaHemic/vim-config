Hey! Welcome to my vim config repo.

It's just a simple way for me to syncronize my vim settings across multiple systems. It might not make sense for you to use this, as you'll probably want a configuration without the idiosyncracies of my vim preferences.

# Installation
## Linux
1. git clone https://github.com/BananaHemic/vim-config.git
2. cd vim-config
3. sudo sh install.sh

## Windows
1. git clone https://github.com/BananaHemic/vim-config.git
2. cd vim-config
3. install.bat

Then you're ready to rock :wink:
